# Enumerable Methods

In this project, we implemented our own version of Ruby‚Äôs enumerable methods.

## Enumerable Methods: Steps on how it works:
Based on the [documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.1/Enumerable.html) we created our own version to emulate these methods:
- #my_each VS #each
- #my_each_with_index VS #each_with_index
- #my_select VS #select
- #my_all? VS #all?
- #my_any? VS #any?
- #my_none? VS #none?
- #my_count vs #count
- #my_map VS #map
- #my_inject VS #inject
- #multiply_els VS #inject that multiplies all the elements of the array together
